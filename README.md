Business analytics (optimization) with python 

This project is developed to support teaching optimization and business analytics with python based implmentations, which offers an alternative to excel solver based implementation. 

The benefit of this approach is that students have a seamless experience from model setup to solution implementation, where a direct analogy between mathematical model and python implementation can be easily observed and understood.
