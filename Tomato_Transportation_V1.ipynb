        "* Minimize the total shipping cost,  \n",

        "A special technique in the model formulation is sparse reprentation, where we significantly reduce the number of decision variables by restricting the set of decisions to be on the valid routes only. This benefit becomes more significant as problem size grows.\n",

        "This tomato shipment model can be used in many different settings to help companies make informed decisions about satisfying customer demands from a set of plants where there are transit stations allowing for transhipments.\n"
