The company implements a flexible working policy, which states that each full-time employee can work any five days and take two days off in a week. For example, an employee can work on Monday to Thursday and Saturday while taking Friday and Sunday off. The company wants to meet its daily requirements using only full-time employees. The employees are paid \\$200 pay day if they work on regular weekdays while receive an additional \\$100 per day if they work over the weekend. The company's objective is to minimize its payroll expenses.\n",
