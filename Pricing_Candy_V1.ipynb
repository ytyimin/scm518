        "Most people value the first piece of candy they purchase more than the second piece. They also value the second piece more than the third piece, and so on. How can you take advantage of this when pricing candies? If you charge a single price for each piece of candies, only a few people are going to buy more than one or two pieces. Alternatively, you can try a two-part tariff approach, where you charge an \"entry fee\" to anyone who buys candies, plus a reduced price per piece purchased. \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a resonable single price per piece is \\\\$1.10, then a reasonable two-part tariff might be an entry fee of \\\\$1.50 and a price of \\\\$0.50 per piece. This gives some customers an incentive to purchase many pieces of candies. Becuase the cost of purchasing $n$ packs of candies is no longer a linear function of $n$ - it is now piecewise linear. Thus, the two-part tariff is a nonlinear pricing strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key input is customer sensitivity to price. Rather than having a single demand function, however, here each customer has a unique sensitivity to price. To keep the example small, consider four typical customers from the four market segments where we obtain their willingness to pay for each successive piece of candies. This information is listed in the table below. \n",
