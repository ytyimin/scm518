        "This equipment replacement problem shows you how to use the shortest path approach to find the optimal planning of purchasing and maintainance of an equipment over multiple time periods. The key strategy is to use nodes to represent different quarters and then build valid arcs that connects these nodes to represent the duration of keeping the machine before replacing. For each valid arc,the associated cost can be computed by incorporating purchasing cost, cumulative maintainance cost and the final salvage value before replacing. The objectives of the problem are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Identify optimal equipment replacment schedule over the five year period,\n",
        "* Minimize the total purchasing and maintainance cost while taking into consideration the salvage value, and\n",

These machines require frequent maintenance beacuse of wear and tear, and VanBuren finds that it is sometimes advantageous, from a cost standpoint, to replace machines rather than continue to maintain them. For one particular class of machines, the company has estimated the quarterly costs of maintenance, the salvage value from reselling an old machine, and the cost to purchase a new machine. \n",
        "\n",
        "The maintenance cost and the salvage value depend on the age of the current machine (at the beginning of the quarter). However, the maintenance costs, the salvage values, and the purchase cost do not depend on time. In other words, there is no inflation. \n",
