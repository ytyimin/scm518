        "The Rheem Paper Copmpany produces rolls of paper of various types for its customers. One type is produced in standard rools that are 60 inches wide and (when unwound) 200 yards long. Customers for this type of paper order rolls that are all 200 yards long, but can have any of the widths 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, or 40 inches. In a given week, Rheem waits for all orders and then decides how to cut its 60-inch rolls to satisfy the orders. For example, if there are five orders for 15-inch widths and two orders for 40-inch widths, Rheem could satisfy the order by producing three rolls, cutting each of the first two into a 40-inch and a 15-inch cut (with 5 inches left over) and cutting the third into four 15-inch cuts (with one of these left over). Each week, Rheem must decide how to cut its rolls in the most economical way to meet its orders. Specifically, it wants to cut as few rolls as possible.\n",

        "The stock cutting example shows that to meet the weekly demand of various paper widths, the minimum number of rolls to cut is 47 rolls, with a combination of eight different patterns to cut. Notice that the achieved rolls of different width exceeds the actual requirement, suggesting that a perfect match is not possible to meet, and some waste is necessarily generated. However, from a planning horizon perspective, the excess rolls of paper can be used to satisfy future demand, and therefore the waste is not a concern. The only exception is that pattern G above does generate 3 inches of waste per cut. It is clearly possible to restrict the cuts to generate no waste, that is, certain patterns cannot be cut. What is your take on this aspect?  \n",
        "\n",
        "A key take away of the above example is that the stock cutting problem can be tackled by first generate a set of possible combinations of different options to help the decision making process. This example share similar conceptual approach as the employee scheduling problem we studied earlier, where the availability information must be created based on available information, as opposed to directly provided.
