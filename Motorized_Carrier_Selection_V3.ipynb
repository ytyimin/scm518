        "A key take away of the above example is that the minimum charges can be pre-processed in the input section, so that the model works directly with the correct charges with minimum charge already incorprated. Further, since not every carrier will serve all the routes, we use a sparse representation, i.e., a set of valid tuples of carrier-destination pair, to setup the model. This sparse representation is more efficient than utilizing large numbers for destinations that a carrier does not serve. "
